# SWICU-NOT-WORKING-YET-

there is a problem with switching the sense inside the isr .. it is only done twice then the isr is never served again
i will work on fixing the issue in the next days but i will need to conduct some research first in the matter

# UPDATE:

now everything is working fine with a slight problem in calculating the distance for example if the distance is 4 cm the LEDs keeps flickering between 3 and 4 cm that's the best i can do for now but i will work on making it more accurate.
